# Feed Reader Testing project

This was the sixth project in the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. The objective was to write Jasmine tests for an existing RSS feed-reading application.

## Running the Application

You can run the live application, with tests, [here](http://kevinfrutiger.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feed-reader/).

You can run the files locally by doing the following:

1. Download the .zip file using the **Download ZIP** button located in the GitHub sidebar (or clone the repository).
2. Unzip the file
3. Point your browser to index.html in files that you just unzipped.

## Additional Tests (above required)

There are two additonal specs in the Initial Entries suite:

- A test to check that entry headings are being populated with text
- A **future-feature** test to check that entry authors are being set

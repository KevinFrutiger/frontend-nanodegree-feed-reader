# Feed Reader Testing project

This was the sixth project in the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. The objective was to write Jasmine tests for an existing RSS feed reading application.

## Running the Application

You can run the live application [here]().

You can run the files locally by doing the following:

1. Download the .zip file using the **Download ZIP** button located in the GitHub sidebar (or clone the repository).
2. Unzip the file
3. To run the application, you must run the files through a web server. [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) is a simple local server you can get via npm.
4. Point your browser to index.html in files that you just unzipped.

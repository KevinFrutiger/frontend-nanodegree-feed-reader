# Feed Reader Testing project

This was the sixth project in the _Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree_. The objective was to write Jasmine tests for an existing RSS feed-reading application.

## Running the Application

You can run the live application, with tests, <a href="http://kevinfrutiger.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feed-reader/" target="_blank">here</a>.

**Note**: There is one test that is a test-driven-development test for a future feature and is expected to fail.

Alternativley, you can run the files locally by doing the following:

1. Download the .zip file using the **Download ZIP** button located in the GitHub sidebar (or clone the repository).
2. Unzip the file
3. Point your browser to **index.html** in files that you just unzipped.
